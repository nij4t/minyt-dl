Demonstration of entirely in browser yt-dl
==========================================

Fetch and mux even without installing ffmpeg.  No node/npm required too.

- yt related code: modified excerpt from youtube-dl (https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)
- a/v muxing using ffmpeg.wasm (https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm)


Future plan:
 - Clean up the code
 - Minified muxer-only ffmpeg (or entirely from scratch?) in js/wasm ***
 - Better UI??
